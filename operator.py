"""OPERATORS IN PYTHON :-An operator is a symbol that perform an operation.python have many operator
1. Arithmatic operators - Arithmatic operators are used to perform basic arithmetic operations like +,-,*,/,//,%,**
/ // % DIFFERENCES
* Addition operator :- Add two  value.
Ex:- a = 5
     b = 3
     c = a+b
     print(c)
o/p  - 8
'/'  Division       --> Divides left hand operand by right hand operand
'//' Floor Division	--> remove the decimal part.
'%' Modulus        -->	Divides left hand operand by right hand operand and returns remainder
2. Assignment operators - These are used to assign values to the variables like +=,-=,=,*=
3. Comparison operators - Comparison operators are used to compare two values like ==, >,<, <=,>=
4. Logical operators    - Logical operators are used to combine conditional statements like And or not.
5. Identity operators   - Identity operators are used to compare the memory address of two object
6. Membership operators - Membership operators are used " To check weather the specified value present in
                          iterable object or not".
7. Bitwise operatorss-    Bitwise opreation works on bits and perform bit by bit operation.
what is different between == vs is operator.
 ==vs is:- == is for comparing the two values and 'is' for the memory location comparison.
