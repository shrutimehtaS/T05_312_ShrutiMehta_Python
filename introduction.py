"""
1. what is python.

* Python is an interpreted,object-oriented and high-level programming language.
* Interpreter- It means the source code of a Python program is converted into
  bytecode that is then executed by the Python virtual machine.
* High-level language:-High level language use english words to develop program.These are easy to learn and use.
========================================================================================================================
2. Application of  python.

* It is used to build websites and software.
* automate tasks and conduct data analysis.
* machine learning ,datascience and automation
========================================================================================================================
3. Feature of python.

 feature of python are -
*Free and Open Source
======================:- python language is freely available at the official website and you can download it from the
Google the Download Python keyword. Download Python Since it is open-source, this means that source code is also
available to the public. So you can download it,use it as well as share it.
* Simple
========:- python is a simple programming language. when we read a  python program , we feel like reading english.It
means more clarity and less stress on understanding the syntax of the language.
* Easy to learn
=================:- python uses very few keywords.Its programs use very simple structure.
* Dynamically Typed
====================:-python is a dynamic language because we need not to  decleare the datatype.Python execution
 environment decides the data types depends on the value we are using in python program.
*Interpreter
=============:- Python is an interpreted language, which means the source code of a Python program is converted into
 bytecode that is then executed by the Python virtual machine.
*High level language
=====================:- High level language use english words to develop program.These are easy to learn and use.
*Garbage collection in python
==============================:- It is a inbuilt memory, which store the un-wanted data and improves the memory
 quality.
4. ADVANTAGE OF PYTHON.
========================
1.Easy to Read. 2. Easy to write the code. 3.It has a very supporitve community.
4.It is easy to learn.
5.DISADVANTAGE OF PYTHON.
==========================
1. Python is a time consuming language. 2.It has low execution speed.
3.It is absence in mobile application.
6. WHAT IS .py vs .pyc files - .py files contain the source code of a program.
 .pyc file contains the bytecode of  program. We get bytecode after compilation of .py file (source code).
7. What is PVM.
=================
 The role of pvm is to convert the byte code instruction into machine code.

8.WHAT IS MEMORY MANAGEMENT IN PYTHON.
=======================================
Memory allocation and deallocation are done by during run time automatically.
